At the time Catch was going through an impressive growth phase and finally had the resource to apply to what was several neglected, outdated and generally poorly executed websites. It was my job to drag these properties into the modern internet, focusing on increasing site traffic and improving conversion ratios.</p><p>Our initial tasks revolved around architectural reconfiguring and UX design. It didn't take long however for us to realise that there were some serious <span class="small-cap">s.e.o.</span> issues. Particularly for heavily web dependant company.</p><p>We had an extensive <span class="small-cap">s.e.o.</span> review undertaken by a third-party expert and based on that report, planned and implemented a comprehensive project to fix the host of problems with the site. These fixes include: re-writing all page title and description tags, completely rebuilding the URL structure of the site, redirecting a load of 404 errors and add-on domains, implementing plug-ins to resolve duplicate content issues with Joomla, performance optimisation, redesigning page elements to clarify calls to action... and I could go on.</p><p>Along side these changes we also redesigned many aspects of the site to be simpler and easier to understand. Clarity and function were our priorities.</p><p>As of the writing of this the site has seen a month on month increase in total hits of 52.3%, an increase in Google page impressions of 326.7% and organic Google clicks of 230.8%. On top of that the conversion rate, based on product trials to hits, has decreased from 1:115 to 1:80. This is both an indicator of the extensive work done and the terrible state the site was on originally.</p><p>All in all the site is much healthier now and expected to improve dramatically in the coming months. I've included below some images of how the site looks now as well as some of how it looked prior to our meddling.</article><section><h2 class="works_heading">Project Images</h2>
