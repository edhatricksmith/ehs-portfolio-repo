What was odd about that request was that my experience of developing or even administering an intranet to that point was exactly naught. Not that I let that put me off. My brief was to make it stand out as "creative" against the rest of the company and their respective sites.</p><p>The TRN intranet is built on <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Sharepoint</a>. Fortunately, I didn't have to install the platform itself from scratch but was provided access to a blank sub-site of the greater TRN site. I built the structure, document libraries and lists. As I had no formal training, I created many sections as <span class="small-cap">html</span> components which I placed with the intranet pages in web parts. This had the benefit of bright, creative layouts and interesting navigation.</p><p>It was probably a bit unorthodox but I've had some great feedback from users throughout the company.</p></article><section><h2 class="works_heading">Project Images</h2><div id="container" class="project_width"><a class="fancybox gallery" href="/images/works/projects/creative/image_01_lge.jpg"><div id="project_lg" class="project"><img src="/images/works/projects/creative/image_01_sml.jpg" alt="Creative Intranet - family tree"><div class="caption fade-caption"><h3 class="element_title">Enlarge</h3></div></div></a><a class="fancybox gallery" href="/images/works/projects/creative/image_02_lge.jpg"><div class="project project_sm"><img src="/images/works/projects/creative/image_02_sml.jpg" alt="Creative Intranet - Stooges"><div class="caption fade-caption"><h3 class="element_title">Enlarge</h3></div></div></a><a class="fancybox gallery" href="/images/works/projects/creative/image_03_lge.jpg"><div class="project project_sm"><img src="/images/works/projects/creative/image_03_sml.jpg" alt="Creative Intranet - Carbon"><div> class="caption fade-caption"><h3 class="element_title">Enlarge</h3></div></div></a></div><div class="clearfix"></div></section></div><div class="clearfix"></div><?php include("/home/akolob/public_html/footer.php");?><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/jquery.projects.min.js" ></script><script type="text/javascript">$(".fancybox") .attr('rel', 'gallery') .fancybox({padding : 0 ,minWidth : 215 ,maxWidth : 900 ,autoSize : true ,maxHeight : 600 ,});</script><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/jquery.isotope-min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">$(function(){var $container=$('#container');$container.isotope({itemSelector: '.project'});});</script></body></html>
